    "Let's outline three of the biggest \"domains\" of machine learning tasks we should be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://assets.wordstream.com/s3fs-public/styles/simple_image/public/images/machine-learning1.png?SnePeroHk5B9yZaLY7peFkULrfW8Gtaf&itok=yjEJbEKD\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the three biggest branches: **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, and **reinforcement learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "Supervised learning requires **labeled data**, that is, the training data consists of inputs and known correct outputs. This is the \"bread and butter\" kind of machine learning you will most likely come across. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "- Given a dataset of flower measurements and their corresponding species, learn to classify a flower's species from its measurements\n",
    "- Given a dataset of 32x32 images of handwritten digits, learn to classify an image as one of ten digits\n",
    "- Given a dataset of house pictures and their prices, learn to predict the price of a house given a picture\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, we have lots of examples of the \"correct answers\", and need a machine learning model to learn what function maps from input to output. More on this later!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning deals with **unlabeled data**, and the two most common tasks in the unsupervised learning space is clustering and dimensionality reduction. We'll cover these in more detail later, but to give an idea of what UL is about, let's consider clustering. As the name might suggest, the task of clustering involves taking a bunch of data points and grouping them together into clusters. We don't need labels to perform this!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you had a database of songs with numerical data like BPM, danceability, loudness, valence, etc. (these are <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#object-audiofeaturesobject\">actual metrics you can get from the Spotify API!</a>). You might be interested to see how songs cluster together, and whether those clusters match our perception of genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a little different from supervised and unsupervised learning. RL involves training an **agent** to **interact with an environment** to maximize some reward. In other words, the agent can perform actions which change the environment and yield some reward or punishment. In theory, this is a simplified model of how humans learn (think touching a hot stove, or being rewarded for good grades). The most classic examples of RL are models that play games like Go (see <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far\">AlphaGo</a>) or Mario. RL can be more nuanced, though, like stock trading or learning language."

    "\n",
    "- **Regression** is about predicting a **quantity**; in the example above, temperature. Another example might be predicting someone's age given a picture of their face.\n",
    "- **Classification** is about assigning a **class** (or label) to a given data point; in the example above, \"hot\" or \"cold\". Another example might be classifying paintings as Da Vinci, Van Gogh, or Dali.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how we said supervised learning requires **labeled data**. Let's call the input data $X$ and the output data (what we're trying to predict) $y$. In the most gross oversimplification of machine learning, supervised learning is about finding a function $f$ such that:\n",

There's no glaring red flags, though, so we can probably continue. What's also interesting is that lot area and overall quality don't seem to be particularly associated, which is a good thing- that means they each bring unique information that can help with the regression."
